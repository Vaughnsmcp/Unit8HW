            Vaughn recently moved from Denver with his partner, Daniel. There, he was a prominent member
            of the local music scene performing with varied acts. His genres include everything from 
            classical piano to folk rock to psyche-pop. He spent most of his free time playing out, 
            touring back and forth from coast to coast and in Europe, and recording his own projects as well 
            studio sessions for others.</p>
            <p style="font-size:2vw;">
            Vaughn became interested in coding as he prepares for life's next chapter. He has always been a 
            videogame fan, and originally went to school for classical performace and composition with the goal
            to make original soundtracks for RPGs. He has recently begun working with a friend and amature coder 
            on a DIY game, and coding seemed like a natural step. He's also really, really, really sick of waiting
            tables.</p>
